/// Mechanical assertions for the accessibility **metadata** the manual runbook
/// (issue #21, Phase 6) checks by hand: icon-only control labels, dense-row
/// label/value pairs, and toggle selected-state.
///
/// `performAccessibilityAudit` (see `AccessibilityAuditTests`) validates
/// contrast, hit-region, clipping, and trait *correctness*, but it does not
/// assert that a specific control carries a specific spoken label — that a
/// refresh button says "Refresh all tracked domains" rather than "arrow
/// clockwise". Those strings were one-time manual VoiceOver checks; this file
/// converts the ones reachable without a live network lookup into permanent
/// regression coverage, so a relabel or a lost `.accessibilityValue` fails CI.
///
/// What is deliberately **not** here, and why:
/// - Inspect toolbar Clear/Actions/Export, the bookmark (Save) toggle, and the
///   Timeline grouping control only appear after a completed lookup, which needs
///   the network — non-deterministic in CI. They stay in the manual pass.
/// - VoiceOver speech, the More Content rotor, and custom-content ordering are
///   not observable from XCUITest at all (the rotor is a VoiceOver feature, not
///   an element property). `.accessibilityCustomContent` does not surface as a
///   queryable value here, so the row assertions cover label + value only.
