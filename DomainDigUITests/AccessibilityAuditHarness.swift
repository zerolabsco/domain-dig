///
/// - *A per-screen baseline count.* Audit coverage is not nested across OS
///   versions — the same screen legitimately yields different counts on the
///   floor simulator and the current one, so no single committed number is
///   correct for both.
/// - *An environment variable.* Neither a plain `xcodebuild` env var nor a
///   `TEST_RUNNER_`-prefixed build setting reaches this process, so the toggle
///   silently did nothing. A committed constant also makes "when did contrast
///   become enforced?" answerable with `git blame` instead of CI tribal
///   knowledge.
