# DomainDig Local API — `v1`

The Local API exposes DomainDig's canonical report data to on-device automation
(Shortcuts, scripts, integrations). It is **off by default** and, when enabled,
binds only to loopback.

- **Base URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` (default port `47821`, configurable in
  Settings → Local API)
- **Binding:** loopback only (`acceptLocalOnly`); never reachable off-device
- **Content type:** every response is `application/json`
- **Version:** `v1` (reported in every response envelope)

This document is the stable contract. The response shape is pinned by
`DomainDigTests/LocalAPIContractTests.swift`; `LocalAPIContract` (in
`LocalAPIContract.swift`) is the single source of truth for the version string
and the JSON encoder.

## Authentication

Every request requires the token shown in Settings → Local API, supplied either
way:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
```
X-API-Token: <token>
```

A missing or wrong token returns `401 unauthorized`. Settings → Local API has a
**Copy cURL Command** button that emits a ready-to-run authenticated request.

## Response envelope

Every response — success or error — is wrapped in the same envelope:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "version": "v1",
  "data": { "...": "payload, present on success" }
}
```
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "version": "v1",
  "error": { "code": "not_found", "message": "The requested Local API route does not exist." }
}
```

- On success, `data` holds the endpoint payload and `error` is **omitted**.
- On failure, `error` holds a machine `code` plus a human `message`, and `data`
  is **omitted**.

### Encoding conventions

- **Dates** are ISO-8601 UTC strings, e.g. `"2023-11-14T22:13:20Z"`.
- **Absent optional fields are omitted, not `null`.** Consumers must treat a
  missing key as "not present."
- Object keys are emitted in sorted order (deterministic output; not
  contractually meaningful — do not depend on key order).

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Payload (`data`) fields |
|--------|------|-------------------------|
| GET | `/portfolio` | `summary` → `{ totalDomains, healthyCount, warningCount, criticalCount, changedLast24h, expiringSoonCount, unreachableCount }` |
| GET | `/domains` | `domains: [TrackedDomain]` |
| GET | `/domains/{domain}` | `domain`, `trackedDomain?` (`TrackedDomain`), `latestReport?` (`DomainReport`) |
| GET | `/domains/{domain}/history` | `domain`, `history: [HistoryEntry]` |
| GET | `/events` | `events: [{ timestamp, domain, summary, status, severity }]` |
| GET | `/monitoring` | `isEnabled`, `scope` (`"allTracked"` \| `"selectedOnly"`), `alertsEnabled`, `monitoredDomains: [{ domain, monitoringEnabled, lastMonitoredAt?, lastAlertAt?, certificateWarningLevel }]` |
| POST | `/inspect` | body `{ "domain": "example.com" }` → `report` (`DomainReport`) |
| POST | `/inspect/{domain}` | `report` (`DomainReport`) |
| POST | `/monitoring/{domain}/enable` | `domain`, `monitoringEnabled` |
| POST | `/monitoring/{domain}/disable` | `domain`, `monitoringEnabled` |

`certificateWarningLevel` encodes as `"none"`, `"warning"`, or `"critical"`.

`DomainReport` is the app's canonical report model (the same shape the JSON
export produces); see `DomainReportBuilder.swift` for its fields. It is a large
object and is treated as an additive contract: new fields may appear without a
version bump.

## Error codes

| HTTP | `code` | When |
|------|--------|------|
| 400 | `bad_request` | The HTTP request line/path could not be parsed |
| 400 | `invalid_body` | `POST /inspect` body was not `{ "domain": "…" }` |
| 400 | `invalid_domain` | A path/body domain was empty or invalid |
| 401 | `unauthorized` | Missing or incorrect token |
| 404 | `not_found` | No such route |
| 404 | `domain_not_found` | No local data / tracked domain for the given name |
| 500 | `encoding_failed` | The response could not be encoded |
| 500 | `internal_error` | The request handler failed unexpectedly |

## Compatibility policy

The `version` field follows a semantic-version-style promise:

- **Backward-compatible changes keep `version` at `v1`.** Adding a new endpoint,
  or adding a new field to an existing payload, is non-breaking. **Consumers
  must ignore unknown fields.**
- **Breaking changes bump `version`.** Renaming or removing a field, changing a
  field's type, or changing the meaning/units of an existing field requires a new
  version, an update to this document, and an update to
  `LocalAPIContractTests.swift`.

There are currently no deprecated fields or endpoints. When a field is
deprecated, it will be listed here with the version in which it becomes eligible
for removal, and will remain present for at least one subsequent version.
